Presentation Rehearsal:
The week before the event we would like to have a presentation rehearsal in order to provide feedback. The talk and slides don’t need to be finished nor perfect, we just provide feedback about the overall structure of the presentation and the time it takes for the speaker to present. The rehearsal can be done through Google Hangouts or Skype.

Please let me know which day and hour work best for you.
Anything after 7:00 pm AST usually works well for us.

Event promotion:
In order to promote the event on our social networks, we'll need a picture of you to update our site and create promos. If you have social handles that you're comfortable sharing please feel free to send them as well.

Have fun!
